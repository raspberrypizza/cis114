        Create a webpage that contains a script (meaning it should be using JavaScript to present the result) to display the following:
        * the letters xy in strong (bold) font, with font family Times New Roman, and the color red
        * the numbers 12 that should be written in blue color, and font family Arial
        * the numbers 89 that should be written in green color, emphasized (in italics), and font family Impact
        * Each of these pairs should be separated by one blank space.
        * Your output should look like this: xy 12 89
